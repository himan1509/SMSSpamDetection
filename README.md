Machine Learning Project developed with Python

HOW TO RUN IT:

There are 2 program files:
  -SMSblabla.py
  -SMSblabla.ipynb

1) Run the Python file
  Better do it by using JUPITER NOTEBOOK
2) Open the home.html file in your browser and test it.

Note: The dataset used is the .txt file (SMSSpamCollection.txt), make sure to have it in the same folder as the Python file, otherwise change the address in the code in Python file.

DESCRIPTION:

FLASK is a Web Framework which permits to utilize Python script as a server side code. The trained model is acting as server while we use (or test) it in the browser by the file home.html

gaussianNb() is the mathematical function is used, the accuracy obtained is 96%
